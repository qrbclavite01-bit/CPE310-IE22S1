# ABOUT ME
Hello! I’m Renz, a 2nd-year Industrial Engineering student at Technological Institute of the Philippines - Quezon City, with a strong passion for management, services optimization, and Data Science. I’m currently developing my skills in both engineering and data analytics, with the goal of applying these in management roles and service-oriented industries.

My journey in Industrial Engineering has equipped me with a deep understanding of system design, operations management, and process optimization. Now, I am expanding that foundation by learning Data Science, which I believe is crucial for driving informed decision-making, improving services, and optimizing management processes.

I’m particularly interested in using data science to enhance the efficiency and quality of services, from supply chain management to customer service operations. I aim to bridge the gap between engineering and management by applying data-driven solutions to real-world problems in service industries.
